                           The Sophus Package
                           ------------------ The  Sophus  package  is
written  to compute  with  nilpotent Lie  algebras  over finite  prime
fields. Using  this package,  you can compute  the cover, the  list of
immediate  descendants,  and  the   automorphism  group  of  such  Lie
algebras. You can also test if two such Lie algebras are isomorphic.


             System requirements and installation of Sophus
             ----------------------------------------------

Sophus does  not use external  binaries and, therefore,  works without
restrictions on the type of  the operation system.  It is designed for
GAP4.4  and  no  compatibility  with  previous  releases  of  GAP4  is
guaranteed.

To use Sophus online help it  is necessary to install the GAP4 package
GAPDoc by Frank  Luebeck and Max Neunhoeffer, which  is available from
the GAP site or http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/.

Sophus is  distributed in  standard formats and  can be  obtained from
http://www.sztaki.hu/~schneider/Sophus.  Follow the instructions there
to unpack the archive.
