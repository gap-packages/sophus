                           The Sophus Package
                           ------------------ 

The Sophus package  is written to compute with  nilpotent Lie algebras
over  finite prime  fields. Using  this package,  you can  compute the
cover, the  list of immediate descendants, and  the automorphism group
of such Lie  algebras. You can also test if two  such Lie algebras are
isomorphic.

The  immediate descendant  function  of  the package  can  be used  to
classify  small-dimensional  nilpotent   Lie  algebras  over  a  given
field. For  instance, the package author obtained  a classification of
nilpotent  Lie  algebras  with  dimension  at most  9  over  F_2;  see
www.sztaki.hu/~schneider/Research/SmallLie.

                     Installing the Sophus package
                     ------------------------------

To install the  Sophus package, move the archive  file 'sophus.zoo' or
'sophus.tar.gz' into the `pkg' directory  in which you plan to install
Sophus.  Usually, this will be the directory `pkg' in the hierarchy of
your  version of  GAP 4.  (However,  it is  also possible  to keep  an
additional `pkg'  directory in  your private directories,  see section
"ref:Installing  GAP  Packages" of  the  GAP  4  reference manual  for
details on how  to do this.)  Then unpack the  archive file and that's
it!

Please remember that  if you want to use Sophus  then you'll also need
to install Version >= 1.2 of the AutPGrp package.

To use Sophus online help, it is necessary to install the GAP4 package
GAPDoc by Frank  Luebeck and Max Neunhoeffer, which  is available from
the GAP site or http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/.

                               -----------

If   you   encounter   problems,   please  contact   Csaba   Schneider
(csaba.schneider@sztaki.hu).

When  sending a  bug  report, remember  we  will need  to  be able  to
reproduce the problem.
